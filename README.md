# OpenStreetMap-OSM-to-MySQL
 Convert .osm files into MySQL/MariaDB format for further processing.

 This is my quick & dirty solution to get the data out of a planet.osm file and into a database so that I can query around it in a more flexible way.

 After spending hours trying to figure out Osmium and other alternatives to find that they are all either terrible for performance due to some bad PRs being merged or outright have little to no documentation on how to use it.

 Maybe it'll come in handy for someone else...
